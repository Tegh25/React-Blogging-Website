# Full-Stack React Blogging Website

This full-stack application utilizes React, Node.js, and MongoDB along with a variety of packages and services such as React Router, Express, Axios, and Firebase Auth to create a fully functional blogging website. This website allows users to view various different articles, log in to upvote and comment on those articles, and is complete with a home and an about page.

This application is ready to be hosted on a service such as Google Cloud. However, since hosting is not free, **this project is currently offline**. Please see screenshots and documentation of the finished product below.

A demo of this project can be found here: https://tegh25.github.io/React-Blogging-Website/

The above link is hosted by GitHub Pages which cannot support the backend for this project. As a result, some functionality such as upvoting and commenting is not available.
